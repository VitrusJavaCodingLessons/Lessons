## Beginner Instructions for Pulling the Repository in IntelliJ IDEA

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install IntelliJ IDEA**:
    - Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from the [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (scroll down and download the **community edition**).
    - Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    - On the Welcome screen, click on `Get from VCS` (VCS stands for Version Control System).
    - In the `URL` field, enter the URL of the repository you want to clone. This URL can be found on the repository's GitHub page by clicking the `Code` button and copying the URL.
    - Choose a directory on your local machine where you want to save the project.
    - Click `Clone`.

3. **Open the Project**:
    - After cloning, IntelliJ IDEA will automatically open the project.
    - If it doesn't, go to `File` -> `Open` and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository. Select the project and click `Open`.

4. **Set Up the Project**:
    - IntelliJ IDEA might prompt you to import the project settings. Choose the appropriate options based on your project requirements.
    - Ensure that the JDK (Java Development Kit) is correctly configured. Go to `File` -> `Project Structure` -> `Project` and set the `Project SDK` to the installed JDK version.
